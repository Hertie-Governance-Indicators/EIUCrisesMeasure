## Ireland (2007-01-01)

Having kept its main intervention rate steady for two and a half years, at a historically low 2%, the European Central Bank (ECB) has raised the rate by 150 basis points since December 2005, in six moves of 25 points each, to bring the rate to 3.5% by the end of 2006. At least one further rate rise is likely before the current cycle of monetary tightening comes to an end. Although declines in international oil prices since August 2006 have pushed average euro area inflation back below the ECB's 2% ceiling, the rate of monetary growth and credit expansion to the private sector are still exceptionally high, and the ECB remains concerned about the possible emergence of pressure on the wage front. With monetary policy still accommodating, the ECB believes that liquidity needs to be drained, if inflation expectations are to be anchored at "levels consistent with price stability". The ECB is therefore likely to raise its key refinancing rate by a further 25 basis points to 3.75% in early 2007, as official interest rates return to a more neutral setting. Our baseline forecast, however, is that the strength of the euro's exchange rate should obviate the need for further rises in 2007-08.We expect Irish GDP growth to peak at 6.2% in 2006, before slowing to 5.3% in 2007 and more sharply in 2008 to 3.6%. This anticipated slowdown in growth towards the end of the outlook period is attributable to much weaker private consumption. Net exports will have little impact on overall GDP growth during the outlook period. Private consumption will be fuelled in 2007 by strong employment growth, solid real wage increases, tax cuts, lower inflation and the maturing of a generous government-financed savings scheme. As the latter effect will disappear in late 2007 and employment growth is expected to begin slowing, we expect a sharply lower rate of private spending growth in the second half of the outlook period. Public consumption growth will remain strong at least until the general election, scheduled for mid-2007. Thereafter, we expect some slowdown in its expansion. Growth in investment spending will slow from 6.5% in 2006 to 5.8% in 2007 and 5% in 2008. Strong business confidence and a still-booming construction sector will bolster growth, but an anticipated cooling of the housing market will account for the deceleration over the outlook period. Export growth is expected to average just above 5% in 2007-08. Both demand- and supply-side factors will keep rates of export growth far below those of the 1990s. Slowing domestic demand in the US, Ireland's largest market, an appreciating currency and a gradual erosion of competitiveness will all work against stronger export growth in the outlook period.The world economy has been growing at a strong pace in 2006, but is expected to slow down to more normal growth in 2007 and 2008. This largely reflects a substantial weakening of growth in the US, driven by the downturn in the housing market. Growth in Japan will normalise after a buoyant expansion in 2005 and 2006, while demand from emerging markets, although weakening, will remain strong. Growth in the euro area countries will slow down moderately, as a result of a weaker international environment, fiscal tightening and less expansionary financial conditions. A key risk to this forecast stems from the possibility of a sharper than expected downturn in the US, if high house prices were to continue to fall. The large US current-account deficit could lead to a substantial weakening of demand and a sharp fall in the US dollar, with major negative repercussions for the euro area, and for Ireland in particular, given its heavy dependence on US investment and trade. Further oil price increases could also weaken global demand.
