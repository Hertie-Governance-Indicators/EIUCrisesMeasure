This paper describes the motivation and construction of our new measure
of real-time perceptions of financial market stress based on kernel
principal component analysis (PCA) of
\href{http://www.eiu.com/}{Economist Intelligence Unit} monthly country
reports. Not only do we develop a novel indicator of financial market

indicators.
\end{quote}

Why and how do politicians respond to financial market stress? This
question has attracted considerable attention recently following the
2007-2009 financial crisis and earlier following the late-1990s Asian
financial crisis. However, virtually all of this research lacks a
crucial variable: a real-time indication of the level of financial
market stress that policy-makers believed that they faced. To understand
why politicians made a given policy choice, we need to have a measure
the conditions that they believed they were responding to.

Most research has used \emph{post-hoc} assessments of banking crisis as
a second-best alternative. However, this presents clear problems.
Chiefly, using such measures creates clear selection bias as stress that
politicians responded to effectively will not be selected. In addition,
these measures are typically binary and so give no indication of stress
intensity. The measures are also at gross intervals, typically yearly,
prohibiting sub-annual analysis.

In this paper we aim to overcome these problems by develop a new index
of real-time perceptions of financial market stress. The index is
created using a kernel principal component analysis (PCA) of monthly
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) reports. This measure should supplant
previous second-best measures of financial market stress by researchers
aiming to understand why and how policy-makers respond to financial
crisis. In so doing, we make a contribution to the wider political
science literature by showing how kernel PCA can be used to summarize
vast quantities of qualitative texts into cross-sectional time-series
indicators.

We start the paper by detailing our motivation for creating a real-time
index of perceptions of financial market stress. We then discuss the
construction of the Index and compare it to widely used previous
measures of financial market stress. {[}WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A
REPLICATION OF AN IMPORTANT PAPER{]}.

\section{Motivation}\label{motivation}

Researchers have tended to rely on two data sources for cross-country
information on when a country is facing a financial crisis: Laeven and
Valencia (2013) and Reinhart and Rogoff (2009). Knowing when crises
started (and when they have ended) is crucial for research trying to
understand issues such as how crises affect economic output, how
governments choose to respond to financial market distress, and what the
fiscal costs of financial crises are.

There are a number of problems with these indicators. Unlike economic
recessions, financial crises are poorly defined in previous sources.
This contributes to large inconsistencies between the timing of crises
in the Laeven and Valencia (2013) and Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) data
sets (Chaudron and Haan 2014). For example, Japan is labeled as having a
crisis between 1997 and 2001 by the former, but 1992-1997 in the latter.
Gandrud and Hallerberg (2015) also find that there are significant
difference in crisis timing between different versions of the Laeven and
Valencia (2013) data. Crises are also identified by researchers who know
what happened. Financial market stress that is addressed well by
policymakers, preventing a major crisis, may therefore not be included.
Similarly, stress that is temporarily dampened through unsustainable
policy measures, only to flare up later, is not clearly recorded. This
makes it difficult to adequately study why and how politicians respond
to financial market stress. Related to this, current measures are
dichotomous thus errors have large consequences for creating bias when
used in econometric models. They also do not give any indication of how
severe a crisis is.

Overall, we lack the continuous real-time measure of financial market
stress that we need to be able to adequately examine why and how
policy-makers respond to financial market problems.

There have been a number of recent attempts to create crisis measures
that overcome these issues. Building on {Von Hagen} and Ho (2007), Jing
et al. (2015) developed am index of money market pressure based on
changes in short-term interest rates and stocks of central bank
reserves. However, this measure conflates distress and policy responses,
assuming central banks use the same reaction function to increased
demand for liquidity. Rosas (2009) developed a dynamic latent trait
model of banking system distress. However, his measure relies on
nationally reported data to the IMF's International Financial
Statistics, which Copelovitch, Gandrud, and Hallerberg (2015) show can
be endogenous to financial market distress.

C. Romer and Romer (2014) aimed to address this issue by manually
classifying 24 countries on a 15 point scale capturing the cost of
credit intermediation. They code countries using information from OECD
semi-annual \emph{Economic Outlook} reports from 1967 to 2007. Relying
on contemporaneous reports allows for the construction of a real-time
measure of credit market distress. This would allow us to examine policy
choices that head off trouble or unsustainably prolong brewing
difficulties. Their, relatively, continuous measure gives an indication
of market distress intensity.

Their approach could be improved in a number of key ways. First, they
are necessarily limited to the relatively small sample of OECD
countries. Second, their measure is laborious to create and update.
Third, the scale is created by simply summing

\section{~Creating the Perceptions of Financial Market Stress
Index}\label{creating-the-perceptions-of-financial-market-stress-index}

We propose a new method of estimating a real-time measure of perceptions
of financial market stress. The index is created with kernel principle
component analysis (Scholkopf, Smola, and Muller 1998; Lodhi et al.
2002; Spirling 2012) of monthly country reports from the \emph{Economist
Intelligence Unit}.\footnote{See \url{http://www.eiu.com/}. Accessed May
  2015.}

\subsection{Why the EIU?}\label{why-the-eiu}

The EIU is the product of a an analysis of real-time, third-party
assessments of financial market conditions reported monthly or quarterly
(depending on the country). These reports are both a summary of
real-time information and forecasts on counties' economic conditions as
well as a channel through which this information is disseminated to
public and private actors. Together, the reports create a very large
corpus (more than 20,000 texts from 1997 through 2011 {[}CHECK{]}) of
monthly reports for more than 100 countries. As the texts generally
follow the same format and style, they contain directly comparable
assessments of economic conditions monthly across the globe for a
significant time span. In contrast, the OECD \emph{Economic Outlook}
provides comparable reports for a very small number of wealthy countries
on a bi-annual basis.

\subsection{Summarizing Financial Market Stress in the
EIU}\label{summarizing-financial-market-stress-in-the-eiu}

Our aim is to create an index that classifies financial conditions on a
continuous more-stressed/less stressed spectrum. So we clearly need an
efficient way to summarize the vast quantity of information in the EIU
reports. To do this we first collected and processed the texts. Then we
used kernel principal component analysis to summarize the texts into a
dimension of financial market stress. We rescaled the Index to ease
interpretation. Finally, we used a number of strategies to examine the
Index's validity.

\subsubsection{Text selection}\label{text-selection}

EIU reports contain assessments of a wide range of countries' economies,
not just their financial system. So, our first step was to select the
portions of the EIU texts that contained relevant information about
countries' banking and financial systems. We collected the parsed
reports--the reports were in HTML format. We then extracted the portions
of the texts--headlines and paragraphs--that contained at least one of a
number of keywords concerning banking and financial markets.\footnote{The
  keywords included: \emph{bail-out}, \emph{bailout}, \emph{balance
  sheet}, \emph{bank}, \emph{credit}, \emph{crunch}, \emph{default},
  \emph{financial}, \emph{lend}, \emph{loan}, \emph{squeeze} {[}MAKE
  SURE TO UPDATE{]}. These keywords were adapted from those used by C.
  Romer and Romer (2014) and are intended to select passages that
  discusses credit market conditions.} Due to a significant change in
how the reports were constructed in 2003, we also selected only texts
from 2003 in order to maintain comparability across the time-series.

We then preprocessed these texts using standard techniques (see Grimmer
and Stewart 2013).\footnote{All preprocessing was done using the
  \texttt{tm} package (Feinerer and Hornik 2015) in R (R Core Team
  2015).} This involved removing common English words, such as `was' and
`its', stemming the words so that different variants of the same word
are grouped together, removing extra whitespace between the words,
removing punctuation and numbers. Finally, we dropped texts that
included very few words (less than six). Including these texts prevented
the estimation of the kernel PCA model.

\subsubsection{Kernel Principal Component
Analysis}\label{kernel-principal-component-analysis}

Texts are frequently summarized using unordered `bag-of-words'
approaches, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, that do not retain word
order. The result of these approaches is often clusters of `topics'
within speeches or speeches to clusters (see Grimmer and Stewart 2013
for a review). We would like to accomplish something different. Ideally,
we would like to preserve the order of the words in our texts and we
would like to place the texts on a continuous scale that will be
interpretable as a measure of perceived financial market stress. We
would like to preserve the order of the words in the texts. Many
financial terms such as `credit growth' and `borrowing costs' are used
in completely different senses depending on the adjectives that modify
them. For example, `slowing credit growth' vs. `expanding credit growth'
or `falling borrowing costs' vs. `increasing borrowing costs'. A
bag-of-words approach that treated each word as having meaning as an
individual unit, rather than having meaning in ordered association with
other words, would not adequately capture common and radically different
meanings in the EIU documents.

In order to address these issues we use kernel principal component
analysis. This method was developed by Scholkopf, Smola, and Muller
(1998) and Lodhi et al. (2002) and introduced recently into political
science by Spirling (2012).\footnote{He used it to summarize changing
  trends in treaties between the US government and Native American
  groups.} The unit of analysis is a sub-string kernel: in effect a
short sequence of letters\footnote{Following Spirling (2012), we used
  kernels with a length of 5, i.e.~those that are five letters long. See
  also Lodhi et al. (2002) who demonstrate that in English strings
  lengths between four and seven are often optimal.} that can be shared
within and across words. Thus we can distinguish between two simple
documents with the stemmed strings `slow credit' and `expand credit'.
They share the five character kernels `credit, but differ on 'slowc' and
`pandc' among others. Using Lodhi et al. (2002) we can summarize the
similarity of these documents using with the frequency distribution of
five-length strings that they have in common--one--standardized by
document length. We can find these pairs for all of the documents in our
corpus to create a kernel matrix. Finally, we can scale the documents
using principal component analysis.\footnote{We conducted kernel PCA
  with the R package \texttt{kernlab} (Karatzoglou et al. 2004).}

\subsection{Characteristics of the
Index}\label{characteristics-of-the-index}

\subsubsection{Dimensionality}\label{dimensionality}

To determine the number of dimensions that best describe the data, we
conducted a scree test, the results of which are shown in Figure
\ref{scree_plot}. There is not a clear `elbow' in the plot. This
suggests that there is perhaps substantively meaningful variation in the
first six dimensions. The drop from the first to second component is
substantial. We focus on it as the main dimensions summarizing financial
market conditions.\footnote{We also examined a number of the other
  dimensions. However, these noticeably did not closely correspond to
  our priors about financial market stress based on previous indicators.}

        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{analysis/figures/scree_plot.pdf}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Results}\label{results}

Figure \ref{basic_sample} shows the results of the kernel PCA analysis
for a selection of countries'. We use the first principal component
throughout the paper. Similar plots for all countries in the analysis
are available in the Appendix. Before discussing diving deeper into
these results, it's important to note two simple transformations we
conducted on the raw results. First, we rescaled the index so that it
would be between zero and one. This eases interpretation and
comparability to other measures. Then we slightly smoothed the results
by taking a two period--usually two months--moving average. The results
with these transformations are shown.

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{analysis/figures/select_scores.pdf}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Representation}\label{representation}

What does this dimension represent? We took a number of approaches to
answer this question. First we conducted an `interocular' test,
e.g.~looking a plots of the results and comparing them to our priors on
financial market stress. Second, we used a random forest regression
(Jones and Linder 2015).

\subsubsection{~Comparison to Other Crisis
Measures}\label{comparison-to-other-crisis-measures}

How does our measure compare to previous ways of measuring and timing
financial market stress and crisis? We directly compare our measure to
dichotomous measures in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Laeven and
Valencia (2013) as well as Romer and Romer's (2014) continuous measure.

There are some limitations in comparability based simply on the
different coverage of the different indices. C. Romer and Romer (2014)
in particular largely does not include the most recent crisis in their
sample as they did not collect data past 2007. We had to make a number
of transformations and assumptions to be able to compare the different
data sets. First, the Laeven and Valencia and Reinhart and Rogoff data
on recorded only at yearly intervals. So, we assumed that the crisis
start and end dates they referred to were in the middle of the year,
i.e.~June. Second, we rescaled Romer and Romer's 15-point scale (in
effect 13-points because they do not classify any country-quarter in
their sample as being at the upper two positions on the scale) to be
between 0 and 1 using the same method as above.

    \caption{Comparing Perceptions of Financial Market Conditions to Laeven and Valencia (2012) Banking Crisis}
    \label{compare_1}

    \end{center}

    {\scriptsize{Shadded areas indicate periods that Laeven and Valencia (2012) classify as systemic banking crises.}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Developed vs.~Developing
countries}\label{developed-vs.developing-countries}

An important finding from examining the Index is that there is a clear
difference in the level of perceived financial market stress in
developed and developing countries. Notably, developing countries often
have scores well above 0.5, while many developed countries only reach
this level during financial crises. Developing countries often lack
strong financial institutions and systems {[}CITE{]}, so we should
expect them to face generally tighter credit market conditions than
developed countries. Formal financial markets are less important for
developing countries' economies {[}CITE{]}.

These observations should lead to an important refinement to how the
Index should be interpreted and how it should be used in empirical work.
First, the Index measures banking market conditions, but not ``crisis''
directly. Instead, perceived crisis is likely the result of an
interaction between the Index and the importance of financial markets
for sustaining a country's economy. Though policy-makers in developing
economies face generally tight credit market conditions, these
persistent conditions likely do not threaten the wider \emph{status quo}
economy. As such, we would not expect significant policy responses to
address financial market stress in these places. Conversely, tightening
of credit market conditions in a developed, financialised economy would
likely have large negative implications for the wider economy. So, we
would expect these politicians to respond to worsening credit market
conditions.

Previous measures of financial market distress and crises have generally
been unable to explore this possible interaction. \emph{Post-hoc}
measures of crisis in particular capture the outcome of this process,
rather than the process itself.
